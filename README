rfkill applet
version 0.7

Access to the rfkill switches on the system

Warning: I never programmed python, nor pygtk, never any applet, never
dbus/hal, so please do expect this applet to make your computer disappear
in flames.

Code sources and thanks:
- gfreqlet.sf.net for pygtk applets
- dbus/hal interface by trial and error with loads of help from the
  plasmoid-applet-killswitch of Eva Brucherseifer
  (see http://www.basyskom.org/~eva/log_installation_vaio_z21vnx.html)
- rfkill access mode from the source code of rfkill user space program
  and thanks to hints by Johannes Berg <johannes AT sipsolutions DOT net>


Installation:
- put rfkill-applet.py into /usr/bin/rfkill-applet  (no .py extension!)
  and make it executable (chmod a+x /usr/bin/rfkill-applet)
- put rfkill-applet.server into /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/ and make it
  executable (chmod a+x /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/rfkill-applet.server)
- put rfkill-applet.png into /usr/share/pixmaps
- put rfkill-applet-hardoff.png into /usr/share/pixmaps
- put rfkill-applet.config into 
     either /etc/rfkill-applet.config
     or     $HOME/.rfkill-applet.config
- restart gnome session
- add the applet


By default rfkill-applet will first try to use /dev/rfkill if available
and read/writeable. This access method is the preferred one as it is
less resource intensive (no need to wake up every 3 secs). This interface
to the rfkill subsystem was introduced in the kernel in 2.6.31-rc series.
In case /dev/rfkill is not available or not useable rfkill-applet falls
back to HAL/DBUS access.

To configure /dev/rfkill access I recommend:
- adding a group rfkill
- adding the users that should be allowed to change rfkills to this group
- adding a line to one of the config files for udev (or creating a new one),
  eg /etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules with one line:
  	KERNEL=="rfkill", NAME="rfkill", OWNER="root", GROUP="rfkill", MODE="660"


HAL/DBUS is normally already configured so that each user can access
the rfkill stuff.


Bugs: many, help needed, suggestions welcome!
