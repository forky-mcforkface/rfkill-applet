  * release 0.4

  * change hardware switch detection logic: now there is no special hardware
    switch property, but if *one* value has the hardoff value it is assumed
    that the hardware switch is turned on, otherwise turned off.
    Adjust the config file removing the hardswitch directive, and ignore
    the 5100AGN switch
    WARNING: You have to upate your config files!

  * release 0.3
  * check every 3 secs for updates
    that could be done better maybe by changing the event loop using
    dbus/glib and registering a callback with dbus when the rfkill 
    hardware switch state has changed
  * allow rfkill.name=foobar in config file, so to rename skitches
    adjust config file to strip the sony- prefix from the names
